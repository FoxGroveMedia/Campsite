# Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please email security@foxgrovemedia.com.

While the discovery of new vulnerabilities is rare, we also recommend always using the latest versions of CampsiteJS and its official companion libraries to ensure your application remains as secure as possible.
